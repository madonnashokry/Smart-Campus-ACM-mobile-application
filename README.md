# NFC Access Control and Attendance Tracking System

This project is an NFC (Near Field Communication) based access control and attendance tracking system using host card emulation (HCE) technology. It allows users to utilize their smartphones to emulate NFC cards for accessing secured areas and tracking attendance records.

## Features

- **NFC Host Card Emulation (HCE):** Utilizes HCE technology to emulate NFC cards, allowing users to use their smartphones for access control.
- **Access Control:** Securely restricts access to authorized personnel only.
- **Attendance Tracking:** Records attendance automatically whenever an authorized user taps their smartphone to the reader.
- **User Management:** Administrators can easily manage users and their access permissions through a user-friendly interface.
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Provides real-time monitoring of access events and attendance records.
- **Logging and Reporting:** Logs access events and attendance data for auditing and reporting purposes.
- **Scalable and Flexible:** Designed to be scalable and adaptable to different environments and requirements.

## Requirements

- Android smartphone with NFC support.
- NFC reader compatible with NFC Host Card Emulation (HCE) technology.
- Backend server for user management and data storage (optional).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

2. Install the necessary dependencies as specified in the project documentation.

3. Deploy the backend server if required, and configure the application to connect to it.

4. Build and deploy the application on your Android smartphone.

5. Configure access permissions and user credentials through the administration interface.

## Usage
